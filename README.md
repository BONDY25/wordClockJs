# Word Clock ðŸ•—

## It tells the time... but in words! (js Version)

### This project is kinda ironic condisering I'm dyslexic...

#### Plot

I was watching this YouTube video of a 40'000'000 USD LA mansion tour and there was this clock which told the time in words, the video had a link to the clock, and it was over 2 grand! I though I could make that easy, turn it into an android or IOS app, stick it on a tablet and stick a tablet to the wall!
I did a WinForms mockup, now here is the web app version published to netlify.

#### Top Features:

* It tells the time
* It says the date
* It has a stopwatch
